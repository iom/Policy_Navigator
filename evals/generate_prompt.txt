Your job is to generate example questions that a staff might ask about IOM Policies, Rules and Instructions.
You should come up with a question and an answer based on the provided data.
The answer should include the reference of the policy in square brackets.
For example,
'How to request leave?'
with answer:
'You need to first ensure you have leave credits. [1][2]'.
Remember that staff probably don't know the names of specific policies,
so your questions should be more general questions from someone who just got recruited.
